Here's an introduction to developing Solve4x, along with some guidelines to help things go smoothly.
### Getting Started
1. Start by forking the repository by clicking ![the Fork button.](http://i81.servimg.com/u/f81/16/33/06/11/forkme12.png)
2. Clone the script onto your computer by running ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Solve4x.git``` or if you are using a GUI client, however you clone repositories.
3. Read up on the code and project layout and guidelines below. The [wiki](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki) is a great place to start.
4. After forking, you should create a new branch in your repository for the feature you want to work on, assuming it's not just a very small change or addition. The work that you want to merge into the fork's master for that feature should be written there. Once the feature is complete, simply submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into the fork's master. Please name the branch something related to the changes you are making! It will be easier to identify.
5. Edit away! A list of stuff to do are filed in project [Issues](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/issues). 
6. Once you finish your work, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/pulls) by clicking ![the Pull Request button.](http://i81.servimg.com/u/f81/16/33/06/11/pullre10.png). By pull requesting you give away all rights you may have to your code and agree that no one else has a copyright on it.
7. Pull requests should describe your branch, detail what was added and removed, and describe why you think your pull request should be merged.  Try to use proper grammar please!
8. If everything checks out, your changes will be merged! :D
9. Don't forget to share the project with your friends and ![Star!](http://i81.servimg.com/u/f81/16/33/06/11/star11.png)

### Separate Branches ###
* The `master` branch is where complete, mostly bug-free code belongs. It is this branch that will make up the next, official release. If someone
wanted to download a pre-release version and not worry about it being broken, they would download this branch.
* **Feature branches** are created when large changes need to be made or tested, and it does not need to be done in the `master` branch.
Both forks and the main repository should follow this. This make the process of merging pull requests easier and allows the code to be reviewed and corrected before getting merged into the `master`.
* There occasionally may be branches (such as **gh-pages**) that do not fit into these two categories. Please refer to any open issue or pull request associated with them to learn their purpose.

### Style and Documentation
* Please try to write understandable code and follow best practices it's understandable by other developers.
* And please try to comment your code. I can't read my own code without comments, much less someone else's.

Thanks to [LDR-Importer](http://github.com/le717/LDR-Importer) and [RapidS](https://github.com/TribeX-Software-Development/RapidS) for writing their contributing guidlines I largly followed, and thanks to you for your interest in this project!
