Solve4x
=======

A Java-based program to solve and explain algebra problems

The goal of this program is to generate an audio-visual lesson explaining how to solve the given problem. It aims to be simple to use, but very intuitive.

TODO
====

The validator for the equation is mostly done and working, although it may be completely changed for another one that works differently.
A temporary GUI is in place for testing, but later there will need to be a lot of work on the GUI.
Solver.java is started; Solution.java is tentatively done; as is Step.java. Solver.java is what we need to work on next.
The A/V generator is still a long way down the road.

If you're wondering what's next, read [how the solver works](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Solving) on the wiki and then work on Solver.java.

Documentation
=============
There currently isn't very much documentation, but you can find some on [the wiki](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki). If you're wondering how the program works/should work, checkout [an article about program flow and its general structure](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Program-Flow) (which is also on the wiki). I feel this is the single most important thing to understand in order to understand the code.
