=======

An audio-visual algebra solver

The goal of this program is to generate an audio-visual lesson explaining how to solve a given problem. It aims to be simple to use, but very intuitive.

TODO
====

GUI - 90% finished.  
Solver - Started (about 30%); relies on classes that contain solving strategies  
Equation validator - (95%) appears to be working; will need a few changes and updates  
Solving strategies - not started; they all need to extend Strategies (which is abstract)  
A/V Generator - Not started; a long way down the road  

If you're wondering what's next, read [how the solver works](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Solving) on the wiki.
