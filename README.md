Solve4x
=======

A Java program to solve and explain algebra problems

The goal of this program is to generate an audio-visual lesson explaining how to solve the given problem. It aims to be simple to use, but very intuitive.

TODO
====

GUI - temporary one is in place
Solver - Started; relies on classes that contain solving strategies
Equation validator - appears to be working; might be replaced with one that uses regexes
Solving strategies - not started; they all need to extend Strategies (which is abstract)
A/V Generator - Not started; a long way down the road

If you're wondering what's next, read [how the solver works](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Solving) on the wiki.

Documentation
=============
There currently isn't a lot much documentation, but you can find some on [the wiki](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki). If you're wondering how the program works/should work, checkout [an article about program flow and its general structure](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Program-Flow) (which is also on the wiki). I feel this is the single most important thing to understand in order to understand the code.
