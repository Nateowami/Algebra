Solve4x
=======
An audio-visual algebra solver

The goal of this program is to generate an audio-visual lesson explaining how to solve a given problem. It aims to be simple to use, but very intuitive. It should solve the way a person would, and should _not_ include unnecessary steps. Equations should be displayed as a person would write them, rather than as single line of text.

TODO
====
* GUI - 98% finished.  Colors need some changing, but otherwise it's finished. Some soft colors would be good.
* Solver - Started (about 50%); relies on classes that contain solving strategies  
* Equation validator - (95%) appears to be working; will likely need a few changes and updates  
* Solving strategies - not started; they all need to extend Strategies (which is abstract)  We can start them as soon as the solver is done and a wiki article or two are written about how to make them.
* A/V Generator - Not started; a long way down the road. We may want to create a make-shift one while working on the solver.

Documentation
=============
You can find documentation on [the wiki](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki). If you're wondering how the program works/should work, check out [an article about program flow and its general structure](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Program-Flow) (also on the wiki).
