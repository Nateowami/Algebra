{"name":"Solve4x","tagline":"An audio-visual algebra solver","body":"Solve4x\r\n=======\r\nAn audio-visual algebra solver\r\n\r\nThe goal of this program is to generate an audio-visual lesson explaining how to solve a given problem. It aims to be simple to use, but very intuitive. It should solve the way a person would, and should _not_ include unnecessary steps. Equations should be displayed as a person would write them, rather than as single line of text. It is not intended as a cheat-sheet, but rather as a helpful explainer for a problem the user doesn't understand.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n====\r\n* GUI - 98% finished.  Colors need some changing, but otherwise it's mostly finished. Some soft colors would be good.\r\n* Solver - Started (about 60%); relies on classes that contain solving algorithms  \r\n* Equation validator - (95%) appears to be working; will likely need a few changes and updates  \r\n* Solving algorithms - Barely started; they all need to implement Algorithm. We can start them as soon as the solver is done/debugged.\r\n* A/V Generator - Not started, except for a command line version intended for debugging. The graphical one is a long way down the road.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\nYou can generic documentation (as in \"how it all works\") on [the wiki](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki). For a basic understanding of how the program should work, check out [an article about program flow](https://github.com/Nateowami/Solve4x/wiki/Program-Flow) (also on the wiki).  \r\nThe generated JavaDocs can be found at <http://nateowami.github.io/Solve4x/doc/>.\r\n","google":"UA-48527631-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
